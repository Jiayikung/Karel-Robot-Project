# Karel-Robot-Project
[Karel](https://compedu.stanford.edu/karel-reader/docs/python/en/chapter1.html))is an educational programming language and 
a tool designed to learn the fundamentals of programming. It offers a simplified environment where learners control a virtual robot navigating a grid world.
By writing projects using predefined and limited commands, it also allows learners to execute essential programming concepts such as algorithmic thinking, decomposition, and stepwise refinement. 

## Usage
Using following code to install needed package:
`pip install stanfordkarel`

## Format
Every Karel robot project have the same format:
```
from stanfordkarel import *

def main():
  """
  Body of the function!
  """

# DO NOT EDIT CODE BELOW THIS LINE #
if __name__ == "__main__":
    run_karel_program()
```
