# Karel-Robot-Project

[Karel](https://compedu.stanford.edu/karel-reader/docs/python/en/chapter1.html) is an educational programming language and tool designed to learn the fundamentals of programming. It offers a simplified environment where learners control a virtual robot navigating a grid world.
By writing projects using predefined and limited commands, it also allows learners to execute essential programming concepts such as algorithmic thinking, decomposition, and stepwise refinement. 

## Usage
Using following code to install needed package:\
`pip install stanfordkarel`

## Format
Each Karel robot project has the same format as follows:
```ruby
from stanfordkarel import *


def main():
  """
  Body of the function!
  """


# DO NOT EDIT CODE BELOW THIS LINE #
if __name__ == "__main__":
    run_karel_program()
```
